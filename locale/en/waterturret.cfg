WT-action-delay=Set the time to wait (in seconds) before a turret is checked again. Bigger values could take some load off UPS if you have many turrets, but turrets will spend more time auto-targetting, and it may take longer until they search for new fires in range.\nRange: 5…30\nDefault: 10
WT-fire-extinguish-radius=If a water turret loaded with water is fighting fire, fires in this radius around the target position will be extinguished at once.\nHint: Smaller values are more realistic, while increasing the radius should improve performance.
WT-immunity-spawner=Make spawners immune to damage from steam and water.\nDefault: true
WT-immunity-turret=Make worms and turrets immune to damage from steam and water.\nDefault: true
WT-steam-damage-modifier=If the turret attacks with steam, the damage is multiplied with this factor.\nRange: 5…20\nDefault: 10
